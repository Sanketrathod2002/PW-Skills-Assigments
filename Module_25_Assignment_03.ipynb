        "Q1. **Ridge Regression vs. Ordinary Least Squares Regression:**\n",
        "   - Ridge Regression is a regularization technique used to mitigate multicollinearity in regression models by adding a penalty term to the cost function. This penalty term, controlled by a tuning parameter (lambda), helps to shrink the coefficients towards zero.\n",
        "   - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression, on the other hand, is a traditional regression method that aims to minimize the sum of squared residuals without any penalty for large coefficients.\n",

        "Q2. **Assumptions of Ridge Regression:**\n",
        "   - The assumptions of Ridge Regression are similar to those of Ordinary Least Squares Regression. They include linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normally distributed errors.\n",

        "Q3. **Selection of Tuning Parameter (Lambda) in Ridge Regression:**\n",
        "   - The value of the tuning parameter (lambda) in Ridge Regression is typically chosen through cross-validation techniques such as k-fold cross-validation or leave-one-out cross-validation. These techniques involve trying different values of lambda and selecting the one that results in the best model performance.\n",

        "Q4. **Ridge Regression for Feature Selection:**\n",
        "   - Ridge Regression can indirectly perform feature selection by shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero. Features with coefficients close to zero are effectively excluded from the model, thus acting as a form of feature selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. **Performance of Ridge Regression in the Presence of Multicollinearity:**\n",
        "   - Ridge Regression is particularly useful in handling multicollinearity, as it shrinks the coefficients of highly correlated variables towards each other. This helps to stabilize the model and reduce the sensitivity of the parameter estimates to collinearity.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. **Handling of Categorical and Continuous Variables in Ridge Regression:**\n",
        "   - Ridge Regression can handle both categorical and continuous independent variables. Categorical variables are typically encoded using techniques such as one-hot encoding before applying Ridge Regression.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. **Interpretation of Coefficients in Ridge Regression:**\n",
        "   - The coefficients in Ridge Regression represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable, after accounting for multicollinearity and the penalty term. Larger coefficients indicate stronger relationships, but the interpretation should consider the regularization effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. **Use of Ridge Regression in Time-Series Data Analysis:**\n",
        "   - Yes, Ridge Regression can be used for time-series data analysis, particularly when there are multicollinearity issues or when regularization is desired to prevent overfitting. It can help in stabilizing parameter estimates and improving the generalization of the model. However, care should be taken to appropriately handle the time-series nature of the data, such as incorporating lagged variables or using specialized time-series models.\n",
