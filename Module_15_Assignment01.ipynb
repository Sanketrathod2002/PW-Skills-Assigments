        "**Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves parsing the HTML or XML of a web page and extracting relevant information, such as text, images, links, and more. Web scraping is used to gather data from websites for various purposes, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Collection**: Web scraping is commonly used to collect data from websites for research, analysis, or monitoring purposes. For example, collecting product prices from e-commerce websites, gathering news articles from news websites, or extracting financial data from stock market websites.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Competitive Intelligence**: Businesses use web scraping to gather information about their competitors, such as pricing data, product details, customer reviews, and marketing strategies. This helps businesses stay competitive in the market and make informed decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Lead Generation**: Web scraping is used to extract contact information, such as email addresses, phone numbers, and social media profiles, from websites for lead generation purposes. This data can be used for marketing campaigns, sales outreach, or market research.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Manual Scraping**: Manual scraping involves manually copying and pasting data from web pages into a spreadsheet or text editor. This method is suitable for small-scale scraping tasks but is inefficient for large-scale data extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Web Scraping Libraries**: Web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup (for Python), Scrapy, and Puppeteer (for JavaScript) provide tools and utilities for parsing HTML or XML documents and extracting data from web pages programmatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **APIs**: Some websites offer APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that allow developers to access and retrieve data in a structured format. APIs are typically more reliable and efficient than web scraping, but not all websites offer APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Browser Extensions**: Browser extensions like Web Scraper, Octoparse, and DataMiner provide graphical user interfaces for web scraping. Users can define scraping rules and perform scraping tasks directly within their web browsers.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3. What is Beautiful Soup? Why is it used?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Beautiful Soup is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents and extracting data from web pages. It provides simple and intuitive methods for navigating the parse tree and searching for specific elements or attributes within the document. Beautiful Soup is used for web scraping because:\n",
        "\n",
        "- It simplifies the process of parsing HTML and XML documents, making it easier to extract data from web pages.\n",
        "- It handles malformed or imperfect HTML gracefully, allowing developers to scrape data from a wide range of websites.\n",
        "- It supports various parsing libraries, including Python's built-in `html.parser`, `lxml`, and `html5lib`, giving developers flexibility in choosing the parsing method based on their requirements.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q4. Why is Flask used in this Web Scraping project?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Flask is a lightweight and extensible web framework for Python, commonly used for building web applications and APIs. In this web scraping project, Flask may be used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Provide a web interface for users to initiate and manage scraping tasks.\n",
        "- Serve as a backend server for handling scraping requests, processing scraped data, and serving the scraped data to clients.\n",
        "- Integrate with other libraries and tools, such as BeautifulSoup, to perform web scraping tasks efficiently.\n",
        "- Implement features such as authentication, authorization, and logging to enhance the security and reliability of the web scraping application.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Q5. Write the names of AWS services used in this project and explain the use of each service:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **AWS CodePipeline**: AWS CodePipeline is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the build, test, and deployment phases of your release process. In this project, CodePipeline is used to create a pipeline that automatically builds and deploys the web scraping application whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale web applications and services developed in various programming languages. In this project, Elastic Beanstalk is used to deploy the Flask web scraping application to a scalable and managed environment. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure, such as EC2 instances, load balancers, and auto-scaling groups, allowing developers to focus on application development rather than infrastructure management.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **GitHub**: GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. In this project, GitHub is used as a code repository to store the source code of the web scraping application. It allows developers to collaborate on the project, track changes, and manage code revisions. Additionally, GitHub integrates with AWS CodePipeline to trigger automated builds and deployments whenever changes are pushed to the repository.\n",
