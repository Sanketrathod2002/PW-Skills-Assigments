        "**Q1. What is Bayes' theorem?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Bayes' theorem, named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics. It describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. In simpler terms, it allows us to update our beliefs about the likelihood of an event occurring, given new evidence.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Bayes' theorem can be mathematically expressed as:\n",

        "\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Bayes' theorem is used in various fields such as machine learning, statistics, and medical diagnosis. In practice, it is applied in tasks such as spam filtering, document classification, medical testing, and predictive modeling.\n",

        "**Answer:** Bayes' theorem provides a way to calculate conditional probabilities. It relates the conditional probability of an event occurring given another event to the conditional probability of the latter event occurring given the former event.\n",

        "   - Gaussian Naive Bayes: Suitable for continuous features with a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",

        "   - Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Suitable for binary features, where each feature represents a binary value (0 or 1).\n",
