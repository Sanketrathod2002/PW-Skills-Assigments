        "\n",
        "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique in machine learning where multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random guessing) are combined to create a strong learner. Unlike bagging techniques that build multiple models independently and combine their predictions, boosting trains models sequentially, with each subsequent model focusing more on the instances that were misclassified by previous models.\n",

        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "- Boosting often achieves higher accuracy compared to individual models.\n",
        "- It can handle complex relationships in data and is robust to noise.\n",
        "- Boosting methods, such as AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting, are widely used and well-established in both theory and practice.\n",

        "**Limitations:**\n",
        "- Boosting can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers.\n",
        "- It may be computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, especially if the base learners are too complex.\n",
        "- Interpretability of the final model may be challenging due to the sequential nature of training.\n",

        "Boosting works by sequentially training a series of weak learners, where each subsequent learner corrects the errors of its predecessor. During training, more emphasis is given to instances that were misclassified by previous models, effectively reducing the training error with each iteration. The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all weak learners, typically through weighted averaging.\n",

        "Boosting algorithms combine weak learners by assigning weights to each learner's prediction based on its performance on the training data. Learners that perform well are given higher weights, while learners that perform poorly are given lower weights. The final prediction is a weighted sum or a weighted vote of all weak learners.\n",

        "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a popular boosting algorithm that works by sequentially training a series of weak learners. In each iteration, AdaBoost focuses on the instances that were misclassified by the previous weak learner, assigning higher weights to these instances. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all weak learners, with higher weights given to more accurate learners.\n",

        "\n",
        "In AdaBoost, the weights of misclassified samples are updated in each iteration to give them higher importance in the subsequent training rounds. The weights are adjusted such that misclassified samples receive higher weights, while correctly classified samples receive lower weights. This process focuses the subsequent weak learners on the previously misclassified instances, effectively improving the overall performance of the ensemble.\n",

        "Increasing the number of estimators (weak learners) in the AdaBoost algorithm typically improves the performance of the model up to a certain point. However, adding too many weak learners may lead to overfitting. Generally, increasing the number of estimators allows the model to capture more complex patterns in the data, leading to better generalization performance on unseen data.\n",
