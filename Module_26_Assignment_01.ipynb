        "\n",
        "**Answer:** The decision tree classifier algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the feature space into subsets based on the feature values. This partitioning process is guided by a set of decision rules learned from the training data. At each node of the decision tree, the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data into homogeneous subsets, aiming to maximize the purity or homogeneity of the resulting subsets with respect to the target variable. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth or no further improvement in purity can be achieved. To make predictions for new instances, the algorithm traverses the decision tree from the root node to a leaf node, where it assigns the majority class label of the training instances in that leaf node to the new instance.\n",

        "Q2. Provide a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:** The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification involves recursively partitioning the feature space based on the feature values to minimize impurity or maximize homogeneity in each partition. This is typically achieved using impurity measures such as Gini impurity or entropy. At each step, the algorithm selects the feature and the threshold value that best splits the data into subsets, aiming to maximize the information gain or purity gain. This splitting process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum tree depth or no further improvement in purity can be achieved.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:** In a binary classification problem, a decision tree classifier recursively partitions the feature space into two subsets at each node, corresponding to the two class labels. At each step, the algorithm selects the feature and threshold value that best separates the data into two homogeneous subsets with respect to the target variable. This process continues until a stopping criterion is met. To classify a new instance, the decision tree traverses from the root node to a leaf node based on the feature values of the instance, and assigns the majority class label of the training instances in that leaf node to the new instance.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Geometrically, decision tree classification can be visualized as partitioning the feature space into regions that are separated by hyperplanes perpendicular to the feature axes. Each partition corresponds to a decision boundary determined by the decision rules learned from the training data. To make predictions for a new instance, we determine which region of the feature space the instance falls into by traversing the decision tree from the root node to a leaf node based on the feature values of the instance. The majority class label of the training instances in that leaf node is then assigned to the new instance as the predicted class label.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:** A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted class labels with the actual class labels. It consists of four components: true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). Each row of the confusion matrix represents the instances in an actual class, while each column represents the instances in a predicted class. The confusion matrix can be used to calculate various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, which provide insights into the model's performance across different aspects.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Answer:** Choosing an appropriate evaluation metric is crucial for assessing the performance of a classification model and ensuring it aligns with the problem's objectives. Different evaluation metrics capture different aspects of model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The choice of metric depends on factors such as class imbalance, the cost of false positives and false negatives, and the desired balance between precision and recall. To select the most suitable evaluation metric, one must carefully consider the specific requirements and objectives of the classification problem.\n",

        "**Answer:** An example of a classification problem where precision is the most important metric is email spam detection. In this scenario, precision measures the proportion of correctly classified spam emails among all emails predicted as spam. High precision ensures that legitimate emails are not incorrectly flagged as spam, which is crucial for maintaining user trust and avoiding false alarms. Therefore, maximizing precision is essential in this context, even if it comes at the cost of lower recall.\n",

        "**Answer:** An example of a classification problem where recall is the most important metric is medical diagnosis for a rare disease. In this scenario, recall measures the proportion of correctly identified positive cases (patients with the disease) among all actual positive cases. High recall ensures that as many patients with the disease as possible are correctly diagnosed, minimizing the risk of false negatives (missed diagnoses). Therefore, maximizing recall is critical in this context, even if it leads to more false positives.\n",
