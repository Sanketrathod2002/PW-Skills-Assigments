        "\n",
        "- **Main Difference**: The main difference between Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance lies in how they calculate distance between two points:\n",
        "  - **Euclidean Distance**: It measures the shortest straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.\n",
        "  - **Manhattan Distance**: It measures the distance between two points by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates along each dimension.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Effect on Performance**: The choice of distance metric affects how distance is computed between data points, influencing which points are considered neighbors. Euclidean distance considers the overall straight-line distance, while Manhattan distance considers the sum of distances along each dimension. This difference can affect the shape of decision boundaries and the sensitivity to outliers. For example, Euclidean distance may be more sensitive to variations in all dimensions equally, while Manhattan distance may be more robust to outliers or differences in specific dimensions.\n",
