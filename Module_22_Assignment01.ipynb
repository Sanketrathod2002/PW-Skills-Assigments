        "   \n",
        "   a. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines. For example, a virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa uses AI to understand and respond to user queries.\n",
        "  \n",
        "   b. **Machine Learning (ML):** Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data. An example of machine learning is email spam detection, where the algorithm learns to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails based on labeled data.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   c. **Deep Learning (DL):** Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to learn from data. An example of deep learning is image recognition, where a deep neural network learns to recognize objects in images.\n",

        "6) **What is train, test, and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.**\n",
        "   Train, test, and validation split is a common practice in machine learning where the available dataset is divided into three subsets:\n",
        "   - Training set: Used to train the model.\n",
        "   - Test set: Used to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
