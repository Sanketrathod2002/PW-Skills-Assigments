        "\n",
        "**Answer:**\n",
        "- **Label Encoding:** Label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category in a categorical variable. It does not consider any inherent order or ranking among the categories.\n",
        "- **Ordinal Encoding:** Ordinal encoding assigns numerical values to categories based on their inherent order or rank. Categories are assigned numbers in ascending or descending order, reflecting their position in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "Consider the \"Size\" variable with categories \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large.\" If there is no inherent order, label encoding can be used. However, if there is a natural order (e.g., \"small\" < \"medium\" < \"large\"), ordinal encoding would be more appropriate.\n",

        "**Answer:**\n",
        "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a method where categories in a categorical variable are encoded based on the target variable's mean or median value for each category. This encoding captures the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, making it useful for classification tasks.\n",

        "In a customer churn prediction project, you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding for the \"Education Level\" variable. You encode each education level based on the average churn rate associated with it. Categories with higher churn rates receive higher encoded values, reflecting their impact on the target variable.\n",

        "Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to move in opposite directions. Covariance is crucial in statistical analysis as it helps identify relationships between variables and understand how changes in one variable affect another.\n",
