        "Q1. **What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?**\n",
        "   - The Filter method in feature selection involves evaluating the relevance of each feature independently of the predictive model. It works by ranking features based on their statistical properties, such as correlation with the target variable or information gain. Features are then selected or discarded based on predefined criteria, such as a threshold for correlation or significance level for statistical tests.\n",

        "Q2. **How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?**\n",
        "   - Unlike the Filter method, the Wrapper method evaluates feature subsets by training and testing the predictive model using different combinations of features. It iteratively searches through the space of possible feature subsets, selecting the subset that optimizes a predefined performance metric, such as accuracy or error rate. The Wrapper method tends to be more computationally expensive but can potentially find more informative feature combinations compared to the Filter method.\n",

        "Q3. **What are some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods?**\n",
        "   - Common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods include:\n",
        "     - Lasso (L1 regularization): Penalizes the absolute size of the coefficients in linear models, leading to automatic feature selection.\n",
        "     - Ridge (L2 regularization): Penalizes the squared magnitude of the coefficients in linear models, which can shrink less important features.\n",
        "     - Decision tree-based methods: Trees can naturally perform feature selection by selecting the most informative features at each split.\n",
        "     - Feature importance scores: Algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting Machines provide feature importance scores that can be used for feature selection.\n",

        "Q4. **What are some drawbacks of using the Filter method for feature selection?**\n",
        "   - Drawbacks of the Filter method include:\n",
        "     - It does not consider the interaction between features, potentially leading to suboptimal feature subsets.\n",
        "     - It relies on predefined criteria for feature selection, which may not always capture the most relevant features for the predictive model.\n",
        "     - It may discard potentially useful features if they do not meet the predefined criteria, leading to information loss.\n",

        "     - There is a large number of features, and computational resources are limited.\n",
        "     - The relationship between features and the target variable is relatively simple and can be adequately captured by univariate analysis.\n",
        "     - There is a need for a quick initial feature selection step before applying more computationally expensive methods like the Wrapper method.\n",
